    "It's crucial to be in the root of your directory before creating new ones. The `mkdir` command is used to build a directory structure. For guidance on using this command, refer to `man mkdir`. The manual for `mkdir` is also available at man7.org.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    mkdir data\n",

    "* Wind Speed: The average wind speed of 13.4 km/h, with speeds ranging from 7 km/h to 17 km/h. The standard deviation of 3.5 suggests moderate variability.\n",
    "* Wind Direction: On average, the wind comes from 133 degrees, ranging from 90 to 180 degrees, showing diverse wind patterns. The standard deviation is 21.4.\n",
    "* Humidity: Humidity levels are pretty consistent, with an average of 89.7% and ranges from 82% to 96%. The standard deviation is fairly low at 4.3%.\n",
    "* Rainfall: The average rainfall is 0.2 mm, though heavier precipitation can reach up to 2.2 mm. The standard deviation is 0.5.\n",
    "* Pressure: The average atmospheric pressure is 1005.2 hPa, with values ranging from 998 to 1012 hPa. The standard deviation is 4.4.\n",
