    "* Wind Speed: The average wind speed of 13.4 km/h, with speeds ranging from 7 km/h to 17 km/h. The standard deviation of 3.5 suggests moderate variability.\n",
    "* Wind Direction: On average, the wind comes from 133 degrees, ranging from 90 to 180 degrees, showing diverse wind patterns. The standard deviation is 21.4.\n",
    "* Humidity: Humidity levels are quite consistent, with an average of 89.7% and ranges from 82% to 96%. The standard deviation is fairly low at 4.3%.\n",
